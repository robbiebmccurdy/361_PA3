Programming Assignment #3
CSCI 361
Robert McCurdy

This program allows multiple clients to connect to a server and send two vectors to the server. The client then specifies if they'd like the vectors to be added, subtracted,
or multiplied together using matrix multiplication. All of these calculations are done on the server side and printed out. The vectors are also randomly generated on the
client side.

To run the program, please compile it and then simply run the program with the parameter "sub", "add", or "mul" to specify which operation you'd like to do to the vectors.
